# PUC-Rio Thesis/Dissertation LaTeX template
This repository contains the LaTeX template used for masters and doctoral thesis by PUC-Rio. It is based on the template available only at [Coordenação Central de Pós-graduação (CCPG)](https://www.puc-rio.br/ensinopesq/ccpg/apresentacao_ted.html), however, this version incorporates several fixes made by myself and several other grad-students over the years. This repository is an attempt to centralize and distribute a more up-to-date version of this template.
