# How to contribute

Since this is a very specialized and localized project, we usually do not expect many contributors. However, if you have questions or change proposals, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository
2. Open an issue to discuss your changes or proposals
3. Commit your changes
4. Test the changes and compare with the thesis/dissertation rules set by [CCPG](https://www.puc-rio.br/ensinopesq/ccpg/apresentacao_ted.html)
5. Make a pull request explaining the rationale behind your changes

We don't have a central mailing list, IRC or Slack channels. However I may be reached by email
